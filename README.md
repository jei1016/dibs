# dibs

> Call dibs on your database schema.

A Postgres toolkit for Rust, powered by [facet](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet) reflection.

## Vision

**dibs** is a batteries-included Postgres library that gives you:

- **Schema definition** via Rust structs with facet attributes
- **Migrations** as Rust functions, auto-discovered at runtime
- **Schema diffing** - detect drift between your code and your database
- **Query building** - type-safe queries without a full ORM
- **Data mapping** - seamless row-to-struct conversion

All built on facet's reflection system - no code generation, no build.rs, no macros that hide what's happening.

## Example

None, dibs is in super early stages yet. Hi reddit but god, give me a couple days.

## Thanks

CI runs on [Depot](https://depot.dev/) runners — fast, affordable, and easy to set up.
